# Parking Pickup

Parking Pickup is a browser game mounted at `/games/parking-pickup`. The player clears a jammed parking lot by sending cars into temporary parking spaces while a continuous loop of passengers boards matching cars, across a campaign of hand-authored levels with star ratings.

The page uses `resources/views/layouts/game.blade.php`, matching the PHR and Finance tool pattern: the game has a tool-specific Blade shell that skips the global site navigation instead of toggling `layouts.app`.

## Levels, Stars, And Progression

- The game ships 25 hand-authored campaign levels defined in `resources/js/games/cars/levels/levels.ts`; the random generator only backs levels beyond the authored set. Add levels by appending to `PARKING_LEVELS` — the level select, unlock watermark, and finale messaging derive from the array length.
- The game boots to a level-select grid (Block Blaster pattern): locked tiles past the unlock watermark, star ratings on completed tiles, and a pulse on the next unplayed level. A mid-level snapshot resumes directly into the level.
- Levels 1–8 are self-teaching, one mechanic each (tap-to-park, colors, blocking, capacities, directions, garages, hidden colors, diagonals), with explicit hand-scripted passenger queues and an `intro` message shown at level start. Later levels lean on the deterministic queue planner and named layout motifs (gridlock ring, herringbone, fortress, trophy).
- Stars: 3 for finishing on the starting slots with no power-ups; 2 for one or two assists (extra slots opened + power-ups spent); 1 otherwise. `powerUpsUsed` is tracked on the game state.
- Difficulty badges are authored per level (`difficulty` on the level def; L10/L15 hard, L20/L25 super-hard) instead of the old every-5th-level cadence, which still applies past the authored range.
- Every authored level is validated by `levels.test.ts` via `levelValidation.ts`: bounds, cell overlap, a centerline-clearance check that catches visually-brushing diagonal cars the cell check misses, colorHidden-on-unblocked-car mistakes, queue/seat totals, and a solver + scripted-solution proof on the 4 starting slots. A greedy-peel diagnostic names the deadlocked cars when a layout breaks.
- Progress (`bwh.cars-game.progress.v3`) stores the unlock watermark, per-level best stars, scores, and power-up inventory; the v2 keys are intentionally abandoned (progress reset). Snapshots use `bwh.cars-game.snapshot.v3`.

## Core Loop

1. A level starts with cars placed on a grid, a passenger loop, regular parking spaces, and one VIP parking space.
2. The player clicks a visible car. If the car has a clear path out of the grid, it follows its facing direction to the edge of the board, drives along the board edge, and turns into the first open regular parking space.
3. Passengers walk continuously around the active queue loop. They only try to board when they pass the gate beside the parking spaces.
4. A passenger boards only if a parked car of the same color has an open seat. If no matching car is parked, that passenger keeps walking around the loop.
5. When a car reaches capacity, the final boarding passenger finishes walking to the car, then the car backs out of the parking space, drives off the right side of the screen, and frees its parking space.
6. The level is complete when every car has departed and the passenger queue is empty.

## Visual Style

The target look is a casual-mobile "toy render": saturated candy-colored plastic pieces under soft high-key lighting on flat color-blocked grounds.

- Lighting is deliberately balanced so total irradiance stays near 1.0 — a strong hemisphere + sun stack overexposes under `NeutralToneMapping` and bleaches all saturated albedos toward pastel. If the scene ever looks washed out, check total light intensity before touching material colors.
- `CAR_COLORS` is the single saturated palette for cars and their matching passengers; keep hues toy-like (vivid mid-tones, not neon, not muted).
- Cars are chunky rounded shells with a wrapping dark side-window band, a same-color roof cap (not lightened — depth comes from geometry and shadows), and small tucked-in wheels.
- The roof carries a bold white arrow decal and a white seat-count counter; both must stay readable at gameplay distance.
- Grounds are flat color blocks: saturated grass around the queue, a light plaza around an asphalt car-field slab painted with white stall lines and a border so it reads as a parking lot, a zebra crosswalk linking the queue gate to the parking row, a mid-gray asphalt parking slab with dark slots, gold VIP ticket, and dashed "+" slots.
- Passengers are oversized two-part "gummy" blobs that pack shoulder-to-shoulder in the loop.

## Cars

- Car color determines which passengers can board.
- Car size determines capacity. There are three sizes: 4-seat (length 2), 6-seat (length 3), and 10-seat (length 4). Length is the number of grid cells the car occupies along its facing axis.
- The remaining seat-count badge renders as a billboard sprite that always reads upright in screen space, even as the car rotates between cardinal/diagonal headings.
- Car direction determines its exit path. Cars can face the four cardinal directions or a 45-degree diagonal direction.
- Diagonal cars occupy one grid cell per seat-length step along the diagonal. Their clear path follows that same diagonal heading until the car exits the board.
- Cars cannot cross through other cars.
- Cars cannot cross through active garage cells.
- A clicked car should visibly animate along a natural route: forward to the board edge, around the perimeter lane, then into the parking space. Cars should hold their heading on straight segments and rotate only as they turn into the next segment.
- If a blocked car is clicked, it should drive forward until it reaches the blocking car, then bounce back to its original position.
- Parked cars should align to the parking-space orientation when they arrive.
- Car labels should be readable at gameplay distance. The directional arrow and seat-count counter are rendered as separate square decals on the head side of the car body so they never get squashed by the car's length, and the arrow must point in the car's actual travel direction.
- Hidden garage cars become visible only when they pop out onto the board.
- Some obstructed cars can have their color hidden while they remain blocked. A color-hidden car renders as a near-black silhouette with a "?" decal in place of the arrow, hiding both the color and the seat count; its real color is still used by the solver and passenger queue. The color automatically reveals when the car becomes unobstructed or when a power-up moves it into parking.

## Passenger Queue

- The queue is a continuous loop (stadium-shaped, with two semicircular caps and two straights), not a one-way line.
- Only passengers in the active loop are available to board parked cars.
- Two feeder paths curve into the back of the loop, holding additional passengers behind it.
- The two feeders drain sequentially, not in parallel: the left feeder is consumed first, and the right feeder only begins flowing once the left is empty. Side assignment is fixed per passenger at level generation, so a passenger does not visually switch sides while waiting.
- The loop perimeter is sized so that when at active capacity, the passengers visibly fill it with no extra gap.
- Loop passengers never change position. Each passenger keeps its loop slot (and therefore its offset) for its entire time in the loop — the slot planner does **not** compact/re-index survivors when one boards. When a passenger boards, its slot is simply left empty in place; the gap rides around with the loop rotation and is refilled by a feeder passenger only once that slot reaches the feeder join. This is what keeps the loop animation perfectly smooth: there is no per-boarding lurch and no passenger ever speeds up to close a gap. FIFO still holds because the refill happens at the join (the point farthest from the gate in boarding order), so a newly admitted passenger is always last to reach the gate.
- Passengers from the active feeder walk into the back of the loop along a curved bezier path that joins tangentially. The walk-in is timed to *complete* exactly as the empty loop slot reaches the feeder join, so the passenger merges gracefully into the gap as it arrives rather than chasing a slot that has already advanced (which would cross over the passengers in between). An in-progress walk-in is preserved across scene rebuilds so it never snaps back to the feeder mid-step. When several gaps are pending at once, each walk-in origin is taken from the shared feeder layout so every pending passenger maps to its own distinct feeder row — otherwise same-side pending entries would stack on row 0 and z-fight (the single-file lanes removed the side-to-side jitter that used to mask this).
- The feeder walkway track is drawn along the same path the passengers follow, including the straight continuation past the bezier's end (along its end tangent) that overflow passengers walk on, so the walkway never cuts off mid-queue. The track length scales with the level's feeder count and its far tail clips off-screen.
- Passengers travel single file: one neat line per feeder ramp and one line around the loop, with no side-to-side lane stagger. The queue should read as an orderly procession that files into and out of the loop, not a scattered crowd. (`LOOP_VISUAL_LANE_OFFSETS` / `FEEDER_VISUAL_LANE_OFFSETS` are single-lane `[0]`; widen them only if a deliberate staggered look is wanted.)
- Passenger positions should be stable while walking; they should not appear or disappear except when boarding.
- Passenger boarding is gate-based: a passenger is eligible to board only when their loop position crosses the parking gate at the bottom-front of the stadium.
- Boarding should be tolerant around the gate, but matching must stay visually anchored *to* the gate — a passenger should not board while still in the upper half of the loop. The post-gate boarding window is kept tight (just under one queue-slot, enough to absorb frame-to-frame travel). Because loop passengers never change offset (no compaction), each one's gate crossing fires naturally on the frame it rolls past the gate; there is no slot re-index to erase the crossing, so no wide window and no forced extra lap.
- Boarding should not be globally blocked by unrelated car movement. Only a car that is still driving into its parking space is unavailable for boarding.
- A boarding passenger should visibly leave the queue and walk to the matched parked car instead of disappearing.
- A level is complete only when every car has departed AND both feeder queues plus the loop are empty.
- Limiting the active loop should make color and parking choices matter; a car parked too early may occupy a space until its matching passengers feed into the loop.

## Parking Spaces

- The parking area renders as a single rounded asphalt slab spanning the screen, with the VIP slot on the left and the regular slots to its right; locked slots show a green plus marker.
- All parking spaces (VIP, unlocked, and locked) are the same size and share a uniform slight tilt so the row reads as one row of angled spaces. Parked cars and their entry/exit routes are rotated by the same tilt so they align with the space they occupy instead of sliding in straight and rotating into place.
- The VIP, "+", and other slot labels render as flat textured meshes (not billboards) so they tilt together with their slot.
- Regular parking spaces are the primary constraint. Seven regular slots total; four are unlocked at the start of each level.
- The VIP parking space is separate and does not count against score penalties.
- If all regular parking spaces are occupied, the player can open another regular space.
- Opening more spaces makes the level easier but lowers the score.

### Two-Lane Road

- A two-lane road runs in front of the parking slots along the bottom edge of the asphalt slab.
- Incoming cars use the back lane (closer to the parking slots); outgoing cars use the front lane (closer to the field). Lanes are separated by a dashed white divider, and the two-lane layout prevents incoming and outgoing cars from overlapping when they pass each other.
- The road and asphalt extend past the viewport edges on both sides; departing cars drive off-screen along the front lane instead of disappearing inside the playfield.
- Parking and departure animations both run concurrently — clicking a second car while the first car is still moving must not interrupt either animation.

## Controls

- On portrait screens, the score and level summary is collapsed into a compact top bar so the play area gets most of the viewport.
- The primary action controls overlap the bottom edge of the gameplay area.
- Bottom controls are icon buttons. VIP, Shuffle, Fill, Open Spot, and Reset expose their text labels through shadcn tooltips on hover or focus instead of inline button text.
- The bottom bar styling matches the candy look shared with Marble Sort: the power-up buttons (VIP gold, Shuffle violet, Fill sky) are color-coded with a remaining-count badge and sit in a group divided from the Open Spot / Reset / Tutorial actions, and the desktop Level readout is a gradient pill.
- VIP, Shuffle, and Fill use shadcn confirmation dialogs before the power-up action is committed.
- Each power-up confirmation dialog includes a short description of the effect and a clear action button such as "Use VIP".
- Open Spot has a tooltip but does not use the power-up confirmation flow because it is a parking-space action, not an inventory power-up.

## Garages

- Garages hold hidden cars behind a visible front car.
- Each active garage occupies one real board cell. A visible car emerging from that garage may share its tail cell with the garage so it appears partly inside the doorway.
- The garage cell blocks car placement and car movement like any other obstacle.
- The garage UI is neutral and should not reveal the hidden cars' colors.
- The player should clearly see how many cars remain in the garage through a count badge. The badge is a flat arrow-shaped tag laid above the garage so that its tip points in the direction the next emerging car will travel.
- When the visible garage car leaves the field, the next hidden car pops out.
- Each reveal decreases the garage count.
- Once no hidden cars remain in a garage, the garage cell and UI disappear and no longer block movement.

## Power-Ups

### VIP

VIP lets the player select one visible car from anywhere on the field and place it into the VIP slot. This can bypass normal blocking, but the VIP slot must be open.
The VIP button opens a confirmation dialog before entering VIP selection mode. The power-up is spent when the user selects a car.

### Shuffle

Shuffle changes active car colors into another solvable arrangement based on the current passenger queue. It is a recovery tool for cases where parking choices have made the board difficult or unwinnable.
The Shuffle button opens a confirmation dialog before the colors are changed and the inventory count is consumed.

### Fill

Fill is a cheat power-up. It pulls passengers from the queue in FIFO order to fill all currently parked cars as much as possible, then completed cars depart.
The Fill button opens a confirmation dialog before passengers are pulled from the queue and the inventory count is consumed.

## Level Generation

- Campaign levels 1–25 are hand-authored (see Levels, Stars, And Progression); everything below describes the random generator that backs levels beyond the authored set.
- Levels are randomly generated from a deterministic seed for the level number.
- The playfield is a 20×14 grid. Car counts and the passenger queue scale with level so the field stays densely packed and the queue stays long even at high levels: level 1 starts at roughly 15 cars and the cap grows by ~2.4 per level up to 60. The hidden-garage tier scales similarly so the visible field stays manageable while reserve cars wait behind it.
- Generated levels must be provably winnable without power-ups or opening extra regular parking spaces.
- Generation is validated in two stages: first the board solver proves that every car can physically leave the field, then a parking/queue simulator proves that a scripted solution can finish with only the four starting regular slots.
- A target solver order is computed during generation and resequenced so later recovery tools can still reason from the same board order.
- The solver treats active garage cells as blockers and removes a garage blocker only after the last hidden car has popped out.
- The solver and placement checks support cardinal and diagonal car footprints, so diagonal cars are part of normal generated levels.
- Car colors and passenger queue order are planned as service windows instead of simple same-color blocks. Intended cars get passengers close enough to clear on the scripted path, while tempting movable decoys can have passengers delayed beyond the active loop.
- The queue planner accepts post-tutorial candidates only when the generated level has strategic pressure: multiple movable choices, delayed decoys, and a planned solution that uses multiple starting slots without requiring rescue actions.
- Ten-seat cars are useful anchors because parking one too early can occupy a slot until its passengers feed into the active loop. Four-seat cars are used as relief valves because they can clear slots quickly when they are part of the intended window.
- Hidden-color cars are selected only from obstructed visible cars after the solvable order has been established, so hiding color information does not change the underlying solution.
- The active loop is smaller than the total passenger queue on normal levels, so the full passenger queue is not available immediately. The loop sizes itself to the active capacity so it never has wrap-around overlap — when capacity shrinks (late-level cleanup), excess empty slots are pruned so passengers never land in near-duplicate positions.
- Feeder passengers are persistent render items: as the passengers ahead of them enter the loop, the feeder rows advance and each passenger interpolates to its new row position instead of teleporting between rebuilds. (Loop passengers, by contrast, never move — see the no-compaction note in the Passenger Queue section.)
- Difficulty ramps gradually with level: levels 1–3 remain tutorial-like, levels 4–9 introduce at least one queue-aware decoy choice, level 10+ requires more decision pressure, and super-hard levels require several wrong-choice traps while still preserving a no-rescue solution.

## Scoring And Progress

- Logged-in progress is saved as timestamped account profile and per-level rows; anonymous play uses the versioned local save.
- Saved progress includes the unlocked-level watermark, per-level best stars and scores, total score, high score, and power-up inventory.
- The active level uses a separate `autosave` row; writes and clears for that slot are serialized.
- Level score is finalized when the level is complete.
- Using more regular parking spaces lowers the level score.
- Extra moves can also reduce score.
- The VIP space does not count as a regular parking space for scoring.
- Completing a level awards a random power-up.

- Anonymous/legacy progress key: `bwh.cars-game.progress.v3`
- Anonymous/legacy level snapshot key: `bwh.cars-game.snapshot.v3`
- Rendering uses Three.js through Vite.
- The active loop capacity is intentionally capped in the game engine; remaining visible passengers render on feeder lanes and are not eligible to board until they enter the loop.
- The interface should be playable on a smartphone in portrait orientation, with compact controls and a camera framing that keeps the queue, parking row, and board visible without horizontal scrolling. Landscape support is best-effort with wider aspect ratios.
- Scene rebuilds are split into a static group (ground, queue track, parking row, field) keyed by a signature, and a dynamic group rebuilt every state update. Moving cars (parking and blocked animations) are retained across rebuilds so animations are never cut short when other state changes.
- Car decal textures (the arrow + seat-count badge on top of each car) are cached by remaining seat count, colorblind pattern mode, and hidden-color state so the canvas is only drawn once per distinct value.

## Open Questions

- Whether Fill should ignore color permanently or only fill color-matching parked cars.
- Final tuning for level difficulty, score penalties, and power-up award rates.
- Whether to add sounds, level-complete animation, or more explicit blocked-path feedback.
- Whether feeder path size should vary per level or stay fixed for readability.
